# Lush CLoset Landing page Demo

This repository contains code of my first attemp to create a Landing page for a client
as part of our annual Software Development and Engineering Project of Swinburne University of Technology.

This is my initial version that I've attempted to create which I also deployed online for you to check out.

### Check out the link to the site

### Things worth noting:

* This page is hosted for free on **Netlify**
* The page was created using the web applicaton framework **Nuxt.js**
* The page displays a few photos of what the mobile application looks like which was developed by another team.
* Main purpose of this page is to promote the sale of the mobile application once its developement is completed in the future.
* This is just a demo and it does not depict the final product in any way.
